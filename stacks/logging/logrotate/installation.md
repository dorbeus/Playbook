# Installation and Dependencies of Cerebro

## Installation Steps

Most of the times logrotate will be deployed from pipeline of [this](https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging) repository. It will have updated configurations and dependencies for logrotate. But we can also install it manually (not recommended). To install logrotate manually, clone `https://github.com/stakater/stakaterkubehelmLogging` repo and you can run the make targets of repository containing latest used implementation of logrotate. This will install all dependencies and logrotate as well.
