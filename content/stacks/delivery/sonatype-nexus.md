## Introduction

[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype) is a repository manager that can store and manage components, build artifacts, and release candidates in one central location. At stakater, we use nexus to store docker images of our prod application like stakaterfrontend and emailservice etc.
