# Introduction

Here at Stakater, we have developed a concept called `Stacks`. Stacks means a collection of tools that serves specific purposes like:

1. Control: manages the components of StakaterPlatform.
2. Delivery: manages the artifacts and CI/CD workflows.
3. Logging: manages the logs of kubernetes components and workloads.
4. Monitoring: manages the monitoring of infrastructure and workloads.
5. Security: manages the security aspect of workloads.
6. Alerting: manages alerts for infrasturcture and workloads. 
7. Tracing: provide request tracing between workloads.

Tools in each stack have been selected based on industry standards and recommendations. Detailed description of each stack is provided in below sections.
