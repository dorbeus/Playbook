# ExternalDNS

## Introduction

ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers. ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers. Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the Kubernetes API to determine a desired list of DNS records. Unlike KubeDNS, however, it's not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly.
